#include <iostream>

//learning the main function and how to print a simple line.
int main(){ // int is datatype, main is the function.
    std:: cout <<"I like pizza." << std:: endl; // std is standard. c = character out = output
    return 0; // this is always put at the end of the program. it shows that there is no problem inn the code.
}
// Just like java one has to terminate using semi colon everyafter a line. and use endl for new line or '/n'.
